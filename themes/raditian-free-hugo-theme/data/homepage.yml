  title: Who are We?
  content: '<p class="lead"> DropByte was founded in July 2020, with one goal in mind:
    to help people learn how to use their tech - and do it better. </p> <p class="lead">
    We''re a tech support company that''s different from any you''ve seen before.
    We do all of our work via Zoom video chat, so we are always a call away. If you
    have a problem that requires on-site work, we''ll work with our partners at TwoTone
    Tech Support to send a professional to your home. And unlike other tech support
    companies, we''re not looking for the quick fix that''ll have you calling back
    next week - we find real solutions, just for you. </p>'

    content: Cold calling can be a great way to generate quality leads. You get to
      speak to the gatekeepers and stakeholders, and you get a great insight into
      their requirements and influences. But cold calling is an art-form. It can be
      daunting, itâ€™s always a lot of work, and you always need to make a good impression.
