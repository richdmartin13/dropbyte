#   content: "<p class=\"lead\"> DropByte is a project by Richard Martin that was started
#     in July 2020, with one goal in mind: to help people learn how to use their tech,
#     and do it better.</p> \n<p class=\"lead\"> Our goal at DropByte is different than anything 
#     you've seen before. While we do on-site visits, we do most of our work via Zoom Video Conferencing,
#     so we're always a call away. 
#     And unlike other tech support companies, we''re not looking for the quick
#     fix that''ll have you calling back next week - we find real solutions, just for
#     you.</p>"

  - name: Richard Martin
    position: DropByte Creator
    content: I created DropByte because I wanted to share my knowledge about technology with others.
             I figured out that Zoom was also perfectly usable as a tech support tool. And so, DropByte began. 
             At present, DropByte is just a project that I'm working on. My hopes are to expand to serve both 
             local and domestic clients, and to build a helpful knowledgebase covering
             a vast range of tech-related subjects.
