    position: DropByte Creator
    content: I created DropByte because I wanted to share my knowledge about technology with others.
             I figured out that Zoom was also perfectly usable as a tech support tool. And so, DropByte began. 
             At present, DropByte is just a project that I'm working on. My hopes are to expand to serve both 
             local and domestic clients, and to build a helpful knowledgebase covering
             a vast range of tech-related subjects.
