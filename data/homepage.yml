  title: Who are We?
  content: "<p class=\"lead\"> DropByte is a project by Richard Martin that was started
    in July 2020, with one goal in mind: to help people learn how to use their tech,
    and do it better.</p> \n<p class=\"lead\"> At present, DropByte is a team of one.
    Nonetheless, our goal is different than anything you've seen before. All of our
    work is done via Zoom video chat, so we are always a call away. If you have a
    problem, we'll work with our partners at TwoTone to send a professional to your
    home. And unlike other tech support companies, we''re not looking for the quick
    fix that''ll have you calling back next week - we find real solutions, just for
    you.</p>"

#     content: Cold calling can be a great way to generate quality leads. You get to
#       speak to the gatekeepers and stakeholders, and you get a great insight into
#       their requirements and influences. But cold calling is an art-form. It can be
#       daunting, itâ€™s always a lot of work, and you always need to make a good impression.
