#### How Our Web Platform Works
DropByte uses Hugo, Forestry, Firebase and Github  
`Here's the breakdown:`
* Hugo is a static site generator. Much like wordpress or other sites, it uses highly customizable themes. The DropByte website is a perfect example of all that a Hugo site can do. If you'd like to learn more about Hugo, check it out [here](https://gohugo.io).
* Forestry is a content management system for Hugo sites[^1]. We'll set it up for you and provide you with a password that you an use with your email address. From there, you can quickly edit the content of your website, but any larger changes (ie. images, formatting, and organization) will still have to be made by us. Find out more at their [website](https://forestry.io).
* Firebase is where your website is hosted. By default, your website will have a web address like [your-name-here].web.app, but we can set up your domain address for you, if you have one. If you don't, we'll help you get one if you like.
* Github is our code management system. It allows us to be agile in how we develop your site - while some things are editible with Forestry, most of the customization is hand-coded[^2]. Plus, if your website is broken, we'll be able to quickly roll back the code and get you back up in no time.

#### Website Development, Hosting, and CMS Pricing
* DropByte's website development services are charged at the standard rate of $30 per hour and are subject to the same billing practices as our Remote Support Sessions.
* Hosting and CMS services are billed for an additional $10 per month until cancelled. 
* Domain registration fees and any other applicable fees will be billed to you.
* Source code transfer fees may apply[^2].

[^1]: `Currently, we only support Hugo sites with Forestry. We can host any website that you may have code for, but we will not be able to provide content management services.`
[^2]: `Any code developed by us is the sole property of DropByte and/or its owners unless expressely written otherwise. Therefore, if you would like to host your website on any other platform without DropByte's continued management, you may be subject to extra fees to transfer ownership of the source code.`
