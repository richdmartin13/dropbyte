`We are constantly growing this list as we identify and develop new services`

##### All Plans include:

###### Onboarding Session
Once enrolled in one of our premium subscriptions, we will arrange a one-time onboarding meeting with you for one hour. Our primary goal during this meeting will be to understand your needs and get to know you better. This meeting will be provided at no cost to you.  

###### Access to DropByte's Client Portal, where you can:
* View progress on your support requests
* Send direct messages to DropByte regarding your request
* View and pay invoices  

###### Pay only for the time you use in a session
* DropByte's Remote Sessions are billed to you in fifteen minute increments, rather than the full hour
* Any work done outside of a Remote Session is also billed in fifteen minute increments.  

###### Receive discounts on DropByte Services
