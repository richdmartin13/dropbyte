### What You'll Need

* A Mac desktop or laptop running Mac OS 10.10 or Higher, or
* A Windows PC running Windows 7 or Higher
* An internet connection
* A web browser such as Safari, Edge, Google Chrome, or Firefox

### How to Do It

1. In your web browser, go to [Zoom's home page](https://zoom.us). In the upper right corner, click "sign in." If you do not already have an account, you will have to click "Sign up, it's free" instead.

2. Once you are signed in to your account, you should see a link on the left called "Settings." Click here, and scroll about halfway down until you see an option for remote control.
