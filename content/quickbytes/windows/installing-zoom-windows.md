### Steps  


**1.** On your PC, open a web browser. Since you're already looking at this guide, you can just open a new tab by clicking the + in the upper right corner. Optionally, you can click the link in *step 2*.  
**2.** Go to [Zoom's Download Page](https:zoom.us/download) in a new tab. You can do this by right clicking "Open Link in New Tab."  
**3.** Find the heading, "Zoom Client for Meetings." Click the download button, and allow downloads from zoom.us if prompted.
