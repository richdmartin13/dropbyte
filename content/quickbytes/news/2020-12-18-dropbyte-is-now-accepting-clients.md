### We're Glad You're Here

DropByte was created in July 2020 to address the increased need for reliable tech support, as people began working from home. We saw one major problem with tech support as it currently stands: they address the symptoms, but not the underlying issues.

We're here to do Tech Support differently. If you have a question, need expert advice, or just need a problem fixed, getting answers is as easy as scheduling time with us. And we're building a library of tech guides called QuickBytes, so you can get help right when you need it.

### Our Offerings

DropByte offers two types of tech support. If you are just looking for tech support, you can schedule remote and in-person sessions with us. If, however, you are looking for regular tech support and other benefits, we offer subscription plans as well. And, of course, QuickBytes are free.

#### DropByte Premium

Whether you are looking to upgrade your home technology or are working from home and need tech support, DropByte Premium is for you. With discounts, priority support and more, we'll take care of your tech so you can get back to the things that matter. And DropByte Premium is built for the family, too, so you can keep the family safe and secure. [See Premium](https://dropbyte.ch/premium)

#### DropByte Enterprise

DropByte was built on the transition to working from home. Our Remote Support Sessions allow us to fix problems quickly for the whole office, and we can even hold Tech Training Seminars for your employees. And if you already have existing tech support, we'll always be here for backup. [See Enterprise](https://dropbyte.ch/enterprise)

### Let's Work Together

If you're interested, feel free to [get in touch](https://dropbyte.ch/#contact). We're currently accepting new clients, and we would love to find out what we can do for you.
