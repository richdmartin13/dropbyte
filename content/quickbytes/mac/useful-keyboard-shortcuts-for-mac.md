### What You'll Need

* A Mac Computer running Mac OS X or higher
* The built-in keyboard in your laptop or a magic keyboard

_if you do not have a magic keyboard, a standard keyboard will work. However, the cmd key in this tutorial will be replaced with the windows key._

### How To Do It

There are four different keyboard shortcuts in this tutorial. Though they don't seem like much, they can really speed you up.

1. Copy

`command+c`

2. Paste

`command+v`

3. Cut

`command+x`

4. Print

`command+p`

### What You Should Expect

* You can copy, paste, cut, and print with keyboard combinations
* You can do this in any program, including finder when moving files
