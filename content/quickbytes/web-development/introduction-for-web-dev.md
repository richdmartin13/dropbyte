### How are Websites Made?

Websites are created primarily with three types of code: Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript (JS). Though many websites use all three, it's very common for websites to use only HTML and CSS. 

Think of HTML as a normal text document. Most of what you're doing when you're writing an HTML document is providing descriptive information about the website and determining the order of content on your web page. CSS files are what style web pages. They're fairly simple, but extremely powerful - they determine where _everything_ is on the page. Finally, JS brings with it some extra functionality, allowing you to make requests and interact with other elements.

### How can I Publish a Website?

For the public to access your website, you need to have it hosted on a server. This can be done on your home computer, but it requires a few extra steps, and the computer needs to stay in one place.

At DropByte, we host our website with a variety of tools, from GitHub to Firebase. However, GitHub has a perfectly good hosting setup that we'll take advantage of in this course.

### Can I get My Own Domain?

Of course! There are plenty of domain registrars on the internet that facilitate domain transactions. After you've purchased a domain, you can go into the domain settings and link it to your site.

### What is the Goal of This Course?

This course is designed to provide an entry-level understanding of web development in HTML and CSS. At the end of the course, you will have a single-page personal website with multiple sections.

The intent of this course is to "teach you how to read" HTML and CSS. Just as you learned to read books, you must learn to read code.
