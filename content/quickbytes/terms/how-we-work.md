### QuickBytes

QuickBytes are free guides that are centered around tech skills. You do not have to pay to access them; however, you may pay a small fee for custom guides.

### Remote Support

Remote Support is scheduled only through online scheduling and is booked in one-hour time slots. We bill in hourly increments, subject to the price agreed upon prior to work being done. This rate is generally what is listed in the pricing section on our services page, but may differ under certain circumstances.

These sessions are intended for work that can be done without being physically present. The full offerings of remote sessions are only available for devices with remote control enabled, but we will still be able to guide you through issues if you are calling via Zoom from another device.

Please note that DropByte is not affiliated with Zoom - we only provide links to their download page for ease of access.

### On-Site Meetings

On-Site Meetings are scheduled as a follow-up to Remote Sessions where we were not able to assist you remotely. We bill in hourly increments, subject to the price agreed upon prior to work being done. This rate is generally what is listed in the pricing section on our services page, but may differ under certain circumstances.

These sessions are intended for work that cannot be done without being physically present. On-Site sessions may be advised by DropByte Support, but may also be requested by clients.

If a request for an On-Site Meeting is a known issue (one that has been worked on by DropByte Support Experts previously) then you are welcome to schedule an On-Site meeting without a prior Remote Session.

### Cancellations

If you have scheduled a Remote Session or On-Site Meeting and are no longer able to make the appointment, you may reschedule the appointment at no cost, or cancel the appointment for a 50% refund. Unfortunately, we are not able to provide full refunds at this time for cancellations.

### Referrals

When you refer a friend to us and they schedule a Remote Session an On-Site Meeting, we'll give you a free Remote Session on us. And for every 5 friends you refer, we'll give you a 6th session on us.

### Refunds

DropByte is not just a Tech Support Provider - instead, we are a Tech Support Company with a goal to educate. We are here to make progress towards fixing your technical problems and to help you understand how to best address these kinds of issues in the future. Despite this goal, we understand that we may not be able to solve every problem.

If you are dissatisfied with a Remote Session or an On-Site Meeting, please contact us for a refund of up to 50%. Unfortunately, we cannot offer full refunds at this time. Tech Workshops are non-refundable.
