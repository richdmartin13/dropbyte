### QuickBytes

QuickBytes are free guides that are centered around tech skills. You do not have to pay to access them; however, you may pay a small fee for custom guides.

### Remote Support

Remote Support is scheduled only through online scheduling and is booked in one-hour time slots. Unless you are enrolled in a DropByte Plan, we bill in hourly increments at $30 per hour.

These sessions are intended for work that can be done without being physically present. The full offerings of remote sessions are only available for devices with remote control enabled, but we will still be able to guide you through issues if you are calling via Zoom from another device.

### On-Site Meetings

On-Site Meetings are scheduled through online scheduling, though they may be recommended as a follow-up to a consultation or a remote session. Unless you are enrolled in a DropByte Plan, we bill in hourly increments at $50 per hour.

These sessions are intended for work that cannot be done without being physically present. On-Site sessions may be advised only under the discretion of any Support Expert, but may also be requested by clients.

If a request for an On-Site Meeting is a new issue, we will first schedule a free 15-minute consultation to discuss the details of the issue and gather information. After our research is complete, we will schedule an On-Site meeting to address the problem.

If a request for an On-Site Meeting is a known issue (one that has been worked on by DropByte Support Experts previously) then you are welcome to schedule an On-Site meeting without any consultation.

### Consultations

Free, 15-minute Consultations are only offered for initial discovery of problems. DropByte Support will not provide any advice or solutions during these meetings. Instead, Consultations are for the sole purpose of gathering information related to a specific issue or a variety of requests.

 We may request a consultation with you before an On-Site Meeting if we feel we do not have enough information. Additionally, consultations may extend past their 15 minute scheduled time only if discovery is not complete, at the discretion of any Support Expert. DropByte reserves the right to end or bill for any Consultation in which advice is given or solutions are implemented.

### DropByte Premium & Enterprise

DropByte Premium & Enterprise are monthly subscriptions that provide discounts and other benefits. A full list of benefits for Premium can be found [here](https://dropbyte.ch/premium), and Enterprise benefits can be found [here](https://dropbyte.ch/enterprise).

At the beginning of your Premium or Enterprise subscription, we will schedule an in-person meeting with you to do an initial survey of your current technology. We will document all devices, including serial/IMEI numbers and model numbers. This information will not be shared, though we may use this data when troubleshooting and considering potential upgrades for you. The cost for this survey is a flat charge of $50, regardless of time spent.
